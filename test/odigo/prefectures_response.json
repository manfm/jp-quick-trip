Because of the large number of Buddhist temples, the cuisine has developed over the centuries to include vegetables only found in the Kyoto area to honor the vegetarian lifestyle of the monks who work and pray here. Kaiseki Ryori, a traditional Japanese multi-course haute cuisine originated from this culinary tradition.  In contrast to Tokyo’s fast paced and modern vibe, Kyoto is elegant and refined. To fully enjoy it visitors should slow down, savor, ponder and stroll.\u003c/p\u003e\n","cover_image_url":"https://trip-planner-production.s3.amazonaws.com/production/neighborhood/cover_image/5361e2f269702d5ec2760000/small_21908585854_aeedf14166_k.jpg","big_cover_image_url":"https://trip-planner-production.s3.amazonaws.com/production/neighborhood/cover_image/5361e2f269702d5ec2760000/big_21908585854_aeedf14166_k.jpg","sw":{"lat":34.8044162521854,"lng":135.12223929990228},"ne":{"lat":35.05773903698306,"lng":136.20233268369134},"name_translations":{"en":"Kyoto","zh":"京都"},"neighborhoods":[{"id":"5365c46a69702d343c370000","name":"South Kyoto","name_romaji":"South","name_kanji":"南区","desc":"\u003cp\u003eIncludes Daigo-ji - which is inscribed as a World Heritage Site within the group “Historic Monuments of Ancient Kyoto”\u003c/p\u003e\n","cover_image_url":"https://trip-planner-production.s3.amazonaws.com/production/neighborhood/cover_image/5365c46a69702d343c370000/small_11437391615_76be875c9a_b.jpg","big_cover_image_url":"https://trip-planner-production.s3.amazonaws.com/production/neighborhood/cover_image/5365c46a69702d343c370000/big_11437391615_76be875c9a_b.jpg","sw":{"lat":34.868461413503624,"lng":135.46850743750383},"ne":{"lat":35.12158657904205,"lng":136.3014084384804},"name_translations":{"en":"South Kyoto","zh":"南区"}},{"id":"536518e669702d343c010000","name":"Arashiyama","name_romaji":"Arashiyama","name_kanji":"嵐山","desc":"\u003cp\u003eLocated in the western part of Kyoto, Arashiyama is a nationally-designated Historic Site with multiple National Treasures and World Cultural Heritage sites.

The prefectural capital Nara City is home to eight temples, shrines, and ruins from the ancient first capital of Japan, (Tōdai-ji, Saidai-ji, Kōfuku-ji, Kasuga Shrine, Gangō-ji, Yakushi-ji, Tōshōdai-ji, and the Heijō Palace, together with Kasugayama Primeval Forest.) These inspiring sites collectively form the “Historic Monuments of Ancient Nara”, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Nara is also famous for its furry ambassadors, the tame deer who roam through the town, especially in Nara Park. Snack vendors sell “shika sembei” (deer biscuits) to visitors so they can feed the deer. In addition to the rich history and friendly deer in Nara, there are many cute cafes, restaurants, and shops. The abundant nature outside the city is perfect for hiking and adventuring. Many people only plan a 1/2 day or short stop over in Nara, but there is so much to do here.
