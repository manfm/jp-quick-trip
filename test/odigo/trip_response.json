Located close to the Shinbashi/Shiodome district, Hama Rikyu is a beautiful Japanese garden and a haven away from busy Tokyo life. Because of its close proximity to one of Tokyo’s central business districts, skyscrapers act as a distant backdrop to the gardens offering a visual representation of Tokyo’s constant balance of East meets West, traditional versus modern. I visited Hama Rikyu in the winter, and despite that most of the foliage was already gone, it was a very pleasant experience. \r\n\r\nIt is a great place to walk, and I hear that it’s excellent anytime of the year, as it is a prime spot for autumn leaves changing, plum blossoms in early spring, and cherry blossoms during hanami season.

At 634 meters high, the undisrupted, panoramic view from the top is truly breathtaking. It is worth going there for the view alone, but there are also other great things to see and do in the area! Take a stroll along the beautiful Sumida River and get your first glimpse of the majestic tower. Satisfy your shopping cravings at the unique shops in the Tokyo Solamachi Mall. Have the tallest tempura noodle bowl in Tokyo at Kamimura. Enjoy some time with maritime friends at the Sumida Aquarium.
