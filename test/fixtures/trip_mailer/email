    <p>
      Mid-November to early December is the peak season for autumn foliage and enjoying nature in and around Tokyo. Many parks and temples are bright with momiji (Japanese maple trees.) Tokyo streets are lined with stately, golden yellow ginko trees. You can visit the imperial garden in the city center, or hike mountains and explore beautiful shrines within a day's trip from downtown. These are some of the top spots to enjoy the bright colors and crisp cool weather.
